# Rail Kavach

## 🚆 AI-Powered Railway Animal Detection & Alert System

### Overview

**Rail Kavach** is a smart railway safety system designed to prevent animal accidents on railway tracks using AI-powered detection, automated alerts, and proactive train control measures. The system ensures real-time monitoring, alerts railway authorities, and slows down trains if an animal remains on the track.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Animal Detection

- **With ML:** Cameras capture images at intervals and run an ML model to detect animals.
- If an animal is detected for more than **2 minutes**, the system triggers alerts and actions.

### 2️⃣ Automated Alert & Buzzer System

- If an animal is detected and a train is within **5km**, an **alert is sent** to the nearest railway station and the train driver.
- A **buzzer near the camera** activates to scare the animal away.

### 3️⃣ Automated Train Speed Reduction

- If the train is **5km away** and the animal is still on the track, the train’s speed is **slightly reduced**.
- If the train reaches **2km** and the animal is still there, the train **gradually slows down** further to prevent a collision.

### 4️⃣ Emergency Dashboards

- **Railway Dashboard:** Displays alerts from multiple cameras.
- **Train Dashboard:** Allows drivers to see alerts and the next camera's status.
- **Voice Alerts:** Instead of relying on visual warnings, voice notifications will inform train drivers to minimize distractions.

### 5️⃣ API & Connectivity

- API to fetch real-time **train location**.
- API to calculate **distance between the train and the camera**.
- API to check **camera and nearest station**.

## 🚧 Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### ⚡ 1. Power & Connectivity Issues

- **Challenge:** Remote cameras may face power failures and weak network signals.
- **Solution:** Use **solar-powered cameras** and implement **offline processing** where data can be stored and sent when connectivity is restored.

### 🎯 2. Reducing False Positives & Negatives

- **Challenge:** Shadows, plastic bags, or other objects may trigger false alarms.
- **Solution:** Implement **thermal cameras** or **motion detection** along with AI to improve accuracy.

### 🚄 3. Optimizing Train Speed Reduction

- **Challenge:** Waiting until the train is 2km away before slowing down may be risky.
- **Solution:** Introduce a **gradual slowdown process**, starting minor reductions at 5km and progressively decreasing speed if the animal remains.

### 🔗 4. API Dependency Risks

- **Challenge:** If Gemini API is slow or fails, the system may not work properly.
- **Solution:** Implement **basic edge computing** (lightweight ML models running on local devices) as a backup.

### 🖥️ 5. Usability & Dashboard Design

- **Challenge:** Train drivers may be distracted by checking screens.
- **Solution:** Keep the **dashboard minimal**, use **color-coded alerts**, and implement **voice warnings** for better usability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Suggestions

- **Camera Processing:** OpenCV + TensorFlow/PyTorch/YOLOv8 for ML-based detection.
- **Backend:** Node.js for API development.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Train Communication:** IRCTC Rapid API.
- **Dashboards:** Next.js for Railway and Train dashboards.
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary for image and alert storage.

## 🎯 Best USP (Unique Selling Proposition)

Rail Kavach differentiates itself by using **fixed remote cameras along the railway tracks instead of mounting detection systems on moving trains**. Unlike traditional train-mounted animal detection, which has a limited **field of vision and reaction time**, Rail Kavach’s **static cameras provide real-time monitoring over a larger area**, ensuring that animals are detected much earlier. This allows for **gradual speed reduction, better warning systems, and increased safety margins**, making it a **more effective and proactive solution** for preventing railway accidents.
